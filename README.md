# MyProject
This is my first project .
This is a Number guessing game .
In the functioning of the program the computer cooses a random number from 1-100 and you try to guess it .
It also gives you direction , weather the guessed number is high or low to the actual number .

# Note for Developers 
This is a pretty basic work on python which uses while loop and if-elif-else statement for execution .
